### Current State of the Application
> We have established a basic layout for the application consisting of four fragments that can be swiped through using a ViewPager2.
> We have implemented the camera page to the point where pictures can be taken and the image can be received. Furthermore, the image
> can then be sent to the on-device image processor provided by Google's ML kit library. The processor extracts the text from the
> image, which we, for now, display onto the camera fragment after the image processing is complete. We have also begun working on
> the login and registration of user accounts which has been commented out in the code because it has yet to reach a point of
> completion where it can be displayed. Below you will find images of the current states of each page as well as a short GIF
> that shows a demo of the application running.
